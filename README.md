# meteor-foundation-boilerplate

A Meteor boilerplate based on foundation v6, and inspired by [Differential/meteor-boilerplate](https://github.com/Differential/meteor-boilerplate), a demo is [available here](http://meteorfoundationboilerplate.meteor.com/)

The current foundation template is the agency HTML template.


## To Do

* Fill the readme with package dependencies list
* Fix foundation initialisation ( [see  updated foundation docs](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/blob/develop/meteor-README.md#usage-in-meteor) )
* Add a way to pick one template from foundation sites template list, rather than having a default one
